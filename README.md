I currently act as CEO and software environmentalist at [feenk.com](https://feenk.com), where I work with an amazing team to make the inside of software systems explainable. We invented moldable development and create [Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com).

In 2014 I received the [Dahl-Nygaard Junior Award](http://www.aito.org/Dahl-Nygaard/2014.html) for my work on modeling and visualization of evolution and interplay of large numbers of objects.
